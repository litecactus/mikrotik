# mikrotik
My mikrotik setup script for my RB5009 with WAN on port ether8 and LAN on ether1-7.
This is intended to be a simple setup for UK BT Broadband via PPPoE.

This script can easily be adapted for other Mikrotik devices with 5 ports like the hEX range by commenting out a few lines. I've marked this as comments on the script.
